My first real project, recreating google homepage that we all love so much. This page was build purely with 
html and css using the essential basic html semantic tags and css flex. I had to learn the command line which was quite
an experience and moved to git and finally pushing to github. Had an awesome time doing this even though it
took a couple of days but you know what they say about "GREAT THINGS TAKE TIME, AND QUALITY IS NOT BUILD OVERNIGHT".
Learning and growing everyday :)
